Every aspect of this webapp has been manually tested on a live web server and the code verified. There are known display issues on small screens and small browser windows.

The codebase of this webapp is small enough to not require automated testing. Each PHP unit was tested as it was being created, and PDO->Prepare is in place to eliminate RCE issues.
